Anelectronic inverter is used to do this. Generally a number of PV modules areconnected in series to provide a higher de voltage to the inverter input, andsometimes several of these \u2018series strings\u2019 are connected in parallel, so that a singleinverter can be used for 50 or more modules. Modern inverters are very efficient(typically 97%), and use electronic control systems to ensure that the PV array keepsworking at its optimum voltage. They also incorporate safety systems as required inthe country of use."}, {"image": "ttt.jpg", "body": "Many grid connected PV systems are installed on frames which are mountedon the roof or walls of a building. Used in this way the PV does not take up land thatcould be used for other purposes. Ideally the PV faces towards the equator (i.e. Southin the northern hemisphere) but the exact direction is not critical. However, it isimportant to make sure that there is minimal shading of the PV. The inverter ishoused inside the building and connected to the mains electrical supply, usually witha meter to measure the kWh generated. If the PV electricity production excecdsbuilding demand then the excess can be exported to the grid, and vice versa."}, {"image": "e.jpg", "body": "Transport refers to the activity that facItates movements of goods and Individuals fram oneplace to another, So, It removes the distance barrler.
