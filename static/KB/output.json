[{"image": "ttt.jpg", "body": "In order to supply electricity into a mains electricity system, the de output fromthe module must be converted to ac at the correct voltage and frequency. Anelectronic inverter is used to do this. Generally a number of PV modules areconnected in series to provide a higher de voltage to the inverter input, andsometimes several of these \u2018series strings\u2019 are connected in parallel, so that a singleinverter can be used for 50 or more modules. Modern inverters are very efficient(typically 97%), and use electronic control systems to ensure that the PV array keepsworking at its optimum voltage. They also incorporate safety systems as required inthe country of use."}, {"image": "ttt.jpg", "body": "Many grid connected PV systems are installed on frames which are mountedon the roof or walls of a building. Used in this way the PV does not take up land thatcould be used for other purposes. Ideally the PV faces towards the equator (i.e. Southin the northern hemisphere) but the exact direction is not critical. However, it isimportant to make sure that there is minimal shading of the PV. The inverter ishoused inside the building and connected to the mains electrical supply, usually witha meter to measure the kWh generated. If the PV electricity production excecdsbuilding demand then the excess can be exported to the grid, and vice versa.a) Net MeteringGrid Tied Net Metered systems involve connecting your system to the powergrid but you use the power, and it offsets your electric bill. If you don\u2019t produce asmuch electricity as you use then the grid just supplies the difference and you getbilled for that difference, if you produce more than you use, the excess just goes tothe grid. Whether you get paid for that difference that you supply to the grid depentis94"}]
